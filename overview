**Overview of project:**

In this project,our main ideal is to remove the extra of water from the fields which is the major issue that farmers are facing due to heavy rains,so we are using the ultrasonic sensor and detecting the extra level of water and pumping it out with the help of submersible motor.This water pumped out can be useful other purposes,but as that water flown in the fields which consists of pesticides that water is purified using the activated carbon water filter.Our next step is,to pump the water automatically to the fields by detecting moisture in the soil with the help of soil moisture sensor.We even detect the temperature and humidity with the help of DHT1 sensor.

Our futurescope is,to send the information about the motor ON/OFF to the farmer with the help to the GSM module or create the web page and send that information to the farmer with the help of mobile phone.We want to connect a solar panel and utilize that solar energy for the field activities.
