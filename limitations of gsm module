Bandwidth Lag
Limitations of GSM is that multiple users share the same bandwidth. With enough users, the transmission can encounter interference. Therefore, faster technologies, such as 3G, have been developed on different types of networks than GSM, such as CDMA, in order to avoid such bandwidth limitations.

Electronic Interference
Another limitations of GSM is that it can interfere with certain electronics, such hearing aids. Such interference is due to the fact that GSM uses a pulse-transmission technology. As a result, many locations such as hospitals,petrol pumps and airports require cell phones to be turned off.

Repeaters
In order to increase the coverage repeaters are required to be installed.

Limited data rate
GSM provides limited data rate capability.For higher data rate , GSM advanced version devices are used
