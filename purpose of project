 
USING SOIL MOISURE SENSOR
If the sensed signal is greater than the threshold voltage 
for every particular soil, it means it 
executes the true condition and thus the soil is dry.

The above statement is based on the property of the moisture sensor, i.e., if the sensed value is 
greater than or equal to the threshold voltage, then the soil 
is dry and also if there is no rain.
Because
the condition is true, the Boolean MOTOR will glow ON and the water pump should turn 
ON in order to irrigate the plant.
