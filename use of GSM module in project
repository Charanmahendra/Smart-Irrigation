In our project,we supply water to the fields by detecting the moisture content using soil moisture sensor and to remove the extra water from fields when there are drown conditions as we know that due to heavy rains overflow of water is seen,that extra water is removed by detecting the extra water level using ultrasonic sensor.All these information that is whether is supplied to the fields,whether extra water is removed or not and about the water level in fields is sent to the farmer's mobile as a message which can be done through the GSM module,this doesn't require any Wi-Fi connection.
