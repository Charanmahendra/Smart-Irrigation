Solar photocells catch sunlight that fall into the PN junction. Through the photoelectric effect, electrons that absorb photons will jump across the energy gap barrier, from the valence to the conduction band, and flow out around the circuit, generating electricity. The more light that shines, the more electrons jump up and the more current flows. So, the Current depends on illumination and area but the Voltage depends on built-in field between the P side and the N side.

Virtually all of todayâ€™s solar cells are made from slices of silicon (one of the most common chemical elements on Earth, found in sand, so plenty in Africa!!!)
