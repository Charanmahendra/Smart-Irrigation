**ISSUES FACED WHILE DOING THE PROJECT:**

> Some sensors did not gave the correct values.

> Errors occured in the code due to including the libraries.

> Compiling errors occured while combining the total code.

> It has became complicated to send the MESSAGE with the help of GSM module.

**DOING:**

> Water purification and sending the purified water the storage tank

> Sending the SMS through the GSM module

> Finishing the prototype 

**IMPLEMENTING:**'

> We have check how many sensors are required for particular area of land

> Sending the SMS

> Testing  the prototype in the field
