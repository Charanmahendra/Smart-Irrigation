We are using 12v range solar panel . The nominal voltage is a category. For example, a nominal 12V solar panel has a Voc of about 22V and a Vmp of about 17V. It is used to charge a 12V battery.A 36 cell solar panel is called a 12V “nominal” panel .It is designed to charge a 12V battery.For our project we are using FS6555-III of size 65X65sq.mm
