Water is a precious resource and a driving force in irrigation. Optimal use of water is a need of
the hour. Efficient irrigation watering helps in saving water, getting better plant yields, reduce
dependency on fertilizers and improve crop quality. Various methods, both laboratory and field
including remote sensing are available to measure soil moisture content, but the quickest and better
one is with the use of soil moisture sensor electronic devices. For successful irrigation, it is necessary
to monitor soil moisture content continuously in the irrigation fields. 
The selection of soil moistureprobes is an important criterion in measuring soil moisture as different soil moisture sensors have
their own advantages and disadvantages. The soil moisture sensors are used intensively at present
because it gives real time readings. An attempt is made in this article to review some of the sensors
available, their specifications, properties, applicability, advantages and disadvantages so that an
informed decision on selection of appropriate sensor can be made for a particular application.
