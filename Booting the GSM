Booting the GSM Module!

1. Insert the SIM card to GSM module and lock it.

2. Connect the adapter to GSM module and turn it ON!

3. Now wait for some time (say 1 minute) and see the blinking rate of ‘status LED’ Â or ‘network LED’ (GSM module will take some time to establish connection with mobile network)

4. Once the connection is established successfully, the status/network LED will blink continuously every 3 seconds. You may try making a call to the mobile number of the sim card inside GSM module. If you hear a ring back, the gsm module has successfully established network connection.
