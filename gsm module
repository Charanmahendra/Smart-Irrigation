GSM is a mobile communication modem; it is stands for global system for mobile communication (GSM). The idea of GSM was developed at Bell Laboratories in 1970.  It is widely used mobile communication system in the world. GSM is an open and digital cellular technology used for transmitting mobile voice and data services operates at the 850MHz, 900MHz, 1800MHz and 1900MHz frequency bands.
GSM system was developed as a digital system using time division multiple access (TDMA) technique for communication purpose. A GSM digitizes and reduces the data, then sends it down through a channel with two different streams of client data, each in its own particular time slot. The digital system has an ability to carry 64 kbps to 120 Mbps of data rates.
There are various cell sizes in a GSM system such as macro, micro, pico and umbrella cells. Each cell varies as per the implementation domain. There are five different cell sizes in a GSM network macro, micro, pico and umbrella cells. The coverage area of each cell varies according to the implementation environment.
Time Division Multiple Access:
TDMA technique relies on assigning different time slots to each user on the same frequency. It can easily adapt to data transmission and voice communication and can carry 64kbps to 120Mbps of data rate
