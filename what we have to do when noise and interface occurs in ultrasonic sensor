Any acoustic noise at the frequency to which the ultrasonic sensor is receptive, may interfere with that sensor's output. This includes high-pitched noises such as those created by a whistle, the hissing of relief valves, compressed air or pneumatic devices. You might also get acoustical crosstalk by locating two ultrasonic sensors of the same frequency close together. Another kind of noise, electrical noise, is not exclusive to ultrasonic sensors.
