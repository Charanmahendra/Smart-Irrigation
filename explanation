EXPLANATION:


This block diagram consists of ultrasonic sensor which collects the data of extra level of water,after collectiong the data,if there is any extra level of water in the fields the motor gets ON automatically which can be done even by using the relay as switch.Soil moisture sensor which collects the data of moisture content in soil,after collecting that data,if there is low level of moisture content then the motor gets ON and the water is pumped to the fields.DHT11 sensor collects the data of  temperature and humidity ,this information is collected sent to the farmer as the message with the help of GSM module.Solar panels are used to convert sunlight into electricity and stored in batteries,which can be used for the agriculture or some other purpose.Water pumped out after the data collected from ultrasonic sensor is purified using the activated carbon filter and stored in storage tanks.
